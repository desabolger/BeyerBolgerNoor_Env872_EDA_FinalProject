Experiment:
This data set contains data from an experiment in which green turtle grazing was simulated in a Thalassia testudinum seagrass meadow in The Bahamas from July 1999 until December 2000.

Data Collection:
  Temperature and Salinity
    Measurements of water temperature and salinity were collected weekly. 
    
    Environmental temperature (minimum and maximum values) and salinity were measured 
    weekly. Temperatures were recorded from a minimum-maximum thermometer permanently 
    deployed at seagrass canopy height at one location within each block of plots, and 
    thermometers were re-set each week after reading. Salinity values were measured from     a water sample collected near each thermometer at seagrass canopy height using a 
    hand-held refractometer calibrated before each use.

  Seagrass Characteristics
    Seagrass meadow physical characteristics--blade length, blade width, number of 
    blades per shoot, shoot density, and leaf area index--along with growth rates (both 
    linear growth and production) were measured at various temporal intervals. 
    
    Seagrass structural characteristics (blade length, blade width, shoot density, 
    number of blades per shoot) were measured in all plots prior to the initiation of 
    clipping and every two weeks thereafter. Shoot density and number of blades per 
    shoot were measured in situ from three randomly placed 25 x 25 cm quadrats (0.0625 
    m2) in each plot, and blade morphometry (length and width) was measured in situ from     30 randomly selected blades in each plot. Structural characteristics were then used 
    to calculate one-sided leaf area index (often abbreviated as LAI) (Enríquez and 
    Pantoja-Reyes 2005)—a measure of the available photosynthetic leaf area within one 
    square meter of meadow.
    
    Aboveground biomass was measured in all plots prior to the initiation of clipping by     collecting all seagrass blades from within three randomly placed 25 x 25 cm quadrats     (0.0625 m2). Biomass was measured in this same manner throughout the experiment in 
    reference plots at two, six, eleven, and sixteen months. Following the initiation of     clipping, biomass in clipped plots was measured using all blades collected from the 
    inner 4 m2 area of each plot at each clipping event (when mean blade length reached 
    5 cm). For each plot, collected blades were cleaned of epiphytes and rinsed with 
    seawater in the laboratory, and dry mass was measured after drying at 60 ℃ to 
    constant weight.

    Linear growth rates (i.e. vertical blade growth) were measured using different 
    methods for clipped and reference treatments, so as to avoid repeated destructive 
    sampling within reference plots (Moran and Bjorndal 2005). Since all blades in 
    clipped plots were clipped at the blade-sheath junction at each clipping event, 
    linear growth rates (mm d-1) were calculated from the measured blade length of 30 
    randomly selected blades from each plot at the time of clipping (since all tissue 
    was new growth) divided by the number of days since the previous clipping event. 
    Linear growth in reference plots was estimated using the leaf staple method (Zieman 
    1974) throughout the experiment at roughly two-week intervals. A staple was placed 
    just above the blade-sheath junction in 30 randomly selected blades in each 
    reference plot, and after roughly two weeks (mean 13 days) the new growth between 
    the staple and the blade-sheath junction was measured and divided by the number of 
    days since stapling.
    
    Rates of mass growth (i.e., production) were measured using different methods for 
    clipped and reference treatments. Production (g DM m-2 d-1) in clipped plots was 
    measured at the time of each clipping event, and the dry mass of all blades 
    collected from the inner 4 m2 of each plot (then standardized to 1 m2) was divided 
    by the number of days since the previous clipping event. To avoid repeated 
    destructive sampling in reference plots, rates of production were estimated from 
    other measured metrics using the equation:

    ((SD × BPS × AG × MPA)) / days

    where SD and BPS are shoot density and blades-per-shoot, respectively. AG is blade 
    area growth (mm2 blade-1 d-1) and was calculated using the mean linear growth rate 
    and blade width for each plot following each growth interval. MPA is mass per area 
    of blade (g mm-2), which is a measure of the mass of one square millimeter of 
    seagrass blade tissue, and can be used to estimate production when blade area growth     (AG) is known. MPA was calculated for each clipped plot following clipping events 
    using measured blade length, blade width, blades per shoot, shoot density, and 
    aboveground biomass, and these values of MPA were used to estimate reference plot 
    production assuming MPA to be equivalent for clipped and unclipped blades.
    
  Grazing Simulation
    Grazing was simulated in experimental plots (n = 20; 15 summer- and 5 winter
    -initiated plots) by clipping all seagrass blades within the plot area at the blade\
    -sheath junction with scissors (Moran and Bjorndal 2005) resulting in shoot heights 
    ~2 cm above the sediment surface. To mimic the natural grazing regime of green 
    turtles in this region, blades were re-clipped each time mean blade length within a 
    plot reached 5 cm (range of 12 – 37 days depending on growth conditions), and all 
    clipped blades were collected and removed to simulate green turtle consumption and 
    removal of seagrass biomass and nutrients (Bjorndal 1980; Ogden 1980). Rhizomes were     severed around the edge of each clipped plot at the beginning of the experiment, and     thereafter every 6 – 8 weeks, to prevent nutrient translocation into the plots as 
    part of a separate experiment (Moran and Bjorndal 2007). To avoid possible edge 
    effects from the surrounding ungrazed seagrass, all samples were collected from the 
    inner 2x2 m area of plots leaving a 0.5 m wide buffer zone on all sides.This 
    experimental regime was maintained for the 16-month duration of the experiment. 

    Measurements were made in each of three treatments: 1) an unclipped reference 
    treatment (representing ungrazed seagrass) in which measurements began in July 1999,     2) an experimentally clipped treatment (representing grazing) in which measurements 
    began in July 1999, and 3) an experimentally clipped treatment (representing grazing
    ) in which measurements began in February 2000.
