## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for the Fall 2023 final project in EDA. This document explores the relationship between salinity and production rates of seagrass.

## Notes

For temp/salinity, readings were taken on the same day for either summer/reference or winter/reference. We decided to only use the reference measurements to keep the data uniform.

Production rate (mass growth) readings were not taken the same days as the temp/salinity. They were usually taken the following day.

ex_week (experiment week) is the consistent variable across all the data collected. We used this to join the data frames. 

## Setup

```{r setup}
#loading in necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate)

#checked directory
here()

#create and set theme
mytheme <- theme_grey(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = "darkred"),
        title = element_text(colour = "darkred"),
        axis.text = element_text(colour = "darkblue"))
theme_set(mytheme)
```

## Importing and Cleaning Data

```{r, load in data}
#read in the temp/salinity data
temp_sal <- read.csv(here("./Data/Raw/Temperature-Salinity.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#set date column as date
temp_sal$date <- as.Date(temp_sal$date)

#read in production rate  data
prod_rates <- read.csv(here("./Data/Raw/Seagrass-production-rates.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#set date column as date
prod_rates$date <- as.Date(prod_rates$date)
```

```{r, wrangle the data}
#filtered out the reference treatment only
#omitted any NAs
temp_sal_clean <- temp_sal %>%
  filter(treatment == "reference") %>%
  na.omit()

#selected the desired columns 
#filtered out just the reference treatment
#calculated the mean mass growth
#omitted any NAs
prod_rates_clean <- prod_rates %>%
  select("treatment", "date", "exp_week", "gr_mass") %>%
  filter(treatment == "reference") %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(meangrowth = mean(gr_mass), exp_week = median(exp_week)) %>%
  mutate(treatment = "reference") %>%
  na.omit()
```

```{r, Join data frames}
#joined the salinity and production rate data frames together by the experiment week
joined <- left_join(x = prod_rates_clean, y = temp_sal_clean, join_by(exp_week ==exp_week, treatment ==treatment))

#set date column as date
joined$date.x <- as.Date(joined$date.x)
```

## Plotting the Data

```{r, Plot the data}
#plotted salinity by production rate
ggplot(joined, aes(y = meangrowth, x = salinity)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkblue") +
  labs(y = "Production Rate", x = "Salinity (g/kg)", 
       title = "Salinity v Production Rate",
       subtitle = "EDA Project")
```
> Results: There is a  slight decrease in production rates as salinity increases but the data is fairly dispersed.

## Salinity Analysis

```{r, salinity regression}
#ran linear regression
sal_prod_regression <- 
  lm(data = joined, salinity ~ meangrowth)
summary(sal_prod_regression)
```
> Results: The p-value is 0.6956 and r-squared is -0.02894. There is no significant relationship between salinity and production rates of seagrass.
