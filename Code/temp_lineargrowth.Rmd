## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for the final project in EDA. This document explores the relationship between temperature and linear growth rates of seagrass.

## Notes

For temp/salinity, readings were taken on the same day for either summer/reference or winter/reference. 

Linear growth readings were not taken the same days as the temp/salinity.

ex_week (experiment week) seems to be the consistent variable across all the data collected. We could use this join the data frames

## Set up code

```{r setup}
#Import libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)

#Check that here points to the project folder
here()
```

## Code for cleaning data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r importing data}
# import temperature data
temp <-  read.csv("Data/Raw/Temperature-Salinity.csv")

#import linear growth data
linear_growth <- read.csv("Data/Raw/Seagrass-linear-growth-rates.csv")
```

```{r changing dates}
# change temp date column
temp$date <- as.Date(temp$date)

# change dat column
linear_growth$date <- as.Date(linear_growth$date)

```

```{r wrangling data}
# selecting the date and temp columns, creating a mean temp column, and getting ride of possible NAs
temp_processed <- temp %>% 
  select(date, min_temp, max_temp, exp_week) %>%
  mutate(mean_temp = (min_temp + max_temp) / 2) %>%
  na.omit()

# selecting date and growth length 
linear_growth_processed <- linear_growth %>% 
  select(date, gr_length, exp_week)

```

```{r creating object ID}

temp_processed_OID <- temp_processed %>%
  mutate(OID = paste(treatment, date))

linear_growth_processed_OID <- linear_growth_processed %>%
  mutate(OID = paste(treatment, date))

temp_lineargrowth <- full_join(temp_processed, linear_growth_processed, by = "date")

```
