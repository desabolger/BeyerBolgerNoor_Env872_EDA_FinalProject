## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for the final project in EDA. This document explores the relationship between temperature and linear growth rates of seagrass.

## Notes

For temp/salinity, readings were taken on the same day for either summer/reference or winter/reference. 

Linear growth readings were not taken the same days as the temp/salinity.

ex_week (experiment week) seems to be the consistent variable across all the data collected. We could use this join the data frames

## Set up code

```{r setup}
#Import libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)

#Check that here points to the project folder
here()
```

## Code for cleaning data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r importing data}
# import temperature data
temp <-  read.csv("Data/Raw/Temperature-Salinity.csv")

#import linear growth data
linear_growth <- read.csv("Data/Raw/Seagrass-linear-growth-rates.csv")
```

```{r changing dates}
# change temp date column
temp$date <- as.Date(temp$date)
# creating a month column


# change dat column
linear_growth$date <- as.Date(linear_growth$date)
# creating a month column

```

```{r wrangling data}
# selecting the date and temp columns, creating a mean temp column, and getting ride of possible NAs
temp_processed <- temp %>% 
  filter(treatment == "reference") %>%
  mutate(mean_temp = (min_temp + max_temp) / 2) %>%
  select(date, mean_temp, exp_week) %>% 
  na.omit()

# selecting date and growth length 
linear_growth_processed <- linear_growth %>% 
  filter(treatment == "reference") %>%
  select(date, gr_length, exp_week)
```

```{r joining dataframes}

temp_lineargrowth <- full_join(temp_processed, linear_growth_processed, by = "exp_week")

```

## Code for Plotting

```{r}

growth_time_plot <-
ggplot(temp_lineargrowth,aes(x=date.x,y=gr_length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Growth Length v Time",
       subtitle = "EDA Project",
       y="Growth Length (cm)",
       x="Date")
plot(growth_time_plot)

temp_time_plot <-
ggplot(temp_lineargrowth,aes(x=date.x,y=mean_temp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Temp v Time",
       subtitle = "EDA Project",
       y="Temperature (C)",
       x="Date")
plot(temp_time_plot)

growth_temp_plot <-
ggplot(temp_lineargrowth,aes(x=mean_temp,y=gr_length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Growth Length v Temp",
       subtitle = "EDA Project",
       y="Growth Length (cm)",
       x="Temperature (C)")
plot(growth_temp_plot)

```
