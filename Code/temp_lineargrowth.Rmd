## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for the final project in EDA. This document explores the relationship between temperature and linear growth rates of seagrass.

## Notes

For temp/salinity, readings were taken on the same day for either summer/reference or winter/reference. We decided to only use the reference measurements to keep the data uniform.

Linear growth readings were not taken the same days as the temp/salinity. They were usually taken the following day.

ex_week (experiment week) is the consistent variable across all the data collected. We used this to join the data frames. 

## Set up

```{r setup}
# import libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)

# check that here points to the project folder
here()

# setting plot theme
mytheme <- theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "darkblue"), 
        title = element_text(color='darkgreen'),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray", linetype = "solid"))
# set theme
theme_set(mytheme)

```

## Cleaning Data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r importing data}
# import temperature data
temp <-  read.csv("Data/Raw/Temperature-Salinity.csv")

# import salinity data
salinity <-  read.csv("Data/Raw/Temperature-Salinity.csv")

# import linear growth data
linear_growth <- read.csv("Data/Raw/Seagrass-linear-growth-rates.csv")

```

```{r changing dates}
# change temp date column
temp$date <- as.Date(temp$date)

# change salinity date column
salinity$date <- as.Date(salinity$date)

# change dat column
linear_growth$date <- as.Date(linear_growth$date)
# creating a month column

```

```{r wrangling data}
# filtering for only reference data (represents whole experiment time)
# creating a mean temp column
# selecting needed columns
# getting rid of possible NAs
temp_processed <- temp %>% 
  filter(treatment == "reference") %>%
  mutate(mean_temp = (min_temp + max_temp) / 2) %>%
  select(date, mean_temp, exp_week) %>% 
  na.omit()

# filtering for only reference data (represents whole experiment time)
# selecting needed columns
# getting rid of possible NAs
salinity_processed <- salinity %>%
  filter(treatment == "reference") %>%
  select(date, salinity, exp_week) %>% 
  na.omit()


# filtering for only reference data (represents whole experiment time) 
# selecting needed columns
linear_growth_processed <- linear_growth %>% 
  filter(treatment == "reference") %>%
  select(date, gr_length, exp_week)

```

```{r joining dataframes}
# joining temp data and linear growth by using experiment week
temp_lineargrowth <- full_join(temp_processed, 
                               linear_growth_processed, 
                               by = "exp_week")

# selecting the full date column and removing NAs
temp_lineargrowth_processed <- temp_lineargrowth %>%
  select(date.x, mean_temp, gr_length) %>%
  na.omit()

# joining salinity data and linear growth by using experiment week
salinity_lineargrowth <- full_join(salinity_processed, 
                                   linear_growth_processed, 
                                   by = "exp_week")

# selecting the full date column and removing NAs
salinity_lineargrowth_processed <- salinity_lineargrowth %>%
  select(date.x, salinity, gr_length) %>%
  na.omit()

```


## Plotting Temperature

```{r temp plots}
# plot of linear growth over time
growth_time_plot <-
ggplot(temp_lineargrowth_processed,aes(x=date.x,y=gr_length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
  labs(title = "Growth Length v Time",
       subtitle = "EDA Project",
       y="Growth Length (cm)",
       x="Date")
plot(growth_time_plot)

# plot of temperature over time
temp_time_plot <-
ggplot(temp_lineargrowth_processed,aes(x=date.x,y=mean_temp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
  labs(title = "Temp v Time",
       subtitle = "EDA Project",
       y="Temperature (C)",
       x="Date")
plot(temp_time_plot)

# plot comparing linear growth to temperature
growth_temp_plot <-
ggplot(temp_lineargrowth_processed,aes(x=mean_temp,y=gr_length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Growth Length v Temp",
       subtitle = "EDA Project",
       y="Growth Length (cm)",
       x="Temperature (C)")
plot(growth_temp_plot)

```
> Results: The first graph suggest that seagrass linear growth fluctuated over time seemingly with the seasons. The second graph demonstrations the seasonal shift in temperature. The third graph suggests a positive relationship between seagrass linear growth and temperature. 


## Temperature Analysis

```{r temp linear regression}
temp_growth_regression <- 
  lm(data = temp_lineargrowth_processed,
     mean_temp ~ gr_length)
summary(temp_growth_regression)
```
> Results: p-value = < 2.2e-16, r-squared = 0.4335.  This confirms a significant positive relationship between temperature and seagrass linear growth. This means that seagrass linear growth increases as the temperature increses. 

## Plotting Salinity

```{r salinity plots}
# plot of salinity over time
salinity_time_plot <-
ggplot(salinity_lineargrowth_processed,aes(x=date.x,y=salinity)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  labs(title = "Salinity v Time",
       subtitle = "EDA Project",
       y="Salinity (g/kg)",
       x="Date")
plot(salinity_time_plot)

# plot comparing linear growth to salinity
growth_salinity_plot <-
ggplot(salinity_lineargrowth_processed,aes(x=salinity,y=gr_length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Growth Length v Salinity",
       subtitle = "EDA Project",
       y="Growth Length (cm)",
       x="Salinity (g/kg)")
plot(growth_salinity_plot)

```

> Results: The first graph suggests that salinity is increasing over time. The second graph suggests a negative relationship between salinity and seagrass linear growth.  

## Salinity Analysis

```{r salinity linear regression}
# linear regression of salinity and linear growth
salinity_growth_regression <- 
  lm(data = salinity_lineargrowth_processed,
     salinity ~ gr_length)
summary(salinity_growth_regression)

# linear regression of salinity and time
salinity_time_regression <- 
  lm(data = salinity_lineargrowth_processed,
     salinity ~ date.x)
summary(salinity_time_regression)

```

> Results: For salinity and linear growth the p-value 1.256e-15 and r-squared = 0.1273. This confirms a significant negative relationship between salinity and seagrass linear growth. This means that as salinity increases, seagrass seagrass linear growth decreases. 

> Results: For salinity over time the p-value < 2.2e-16 and r-squared = 0.3869. This confirms a significant positive relationship between salinity over time. This means that salinity was increasing over the time of the experiment.
