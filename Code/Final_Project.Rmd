## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for the final project in EDA. This document explores the impacts of temperature and salinity on linear growth rates and production rates of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum.

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
