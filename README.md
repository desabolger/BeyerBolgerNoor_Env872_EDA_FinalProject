## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

This dataset was created for the Final Course Project for Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872L) at Duke University, Fall 2023. 

This dataset contains data from a study titled “Seagrass growth rates and physical characteristics and measures of water temperature and salinity during a simulated green turtle grazing experiment in The Bahamas, 1999 – 2000,” done in 2022 by Johnson, Hanes, and Bolten. Data was collected to explore abiotic factors controlling seagrass growth and the effects of simulated green turtle grazing.

## Database Information

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

Data were collected from a study on seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) in Lee Stocking Island, Exumas, The Bahamas.  More information can be found here: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.422.1

Data were collected using the Data tool (EDI Data Portal). 

csv files were saved as 'Temperature-Salinity.csv', 'Seagrass-structure.csv', 'Seagrass-production-rates.csv', 'Segrass-linear-growth-rates.csv', and 'Seagrass-aboveground-biomass.csv'. 

Data were accessed 2023-11-01. 

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

<describe the folders contained in the repository, including what type of files they contain>
<describe the formats of files for the various purposes contained in the repository>
<describe your file naming conventions>

Within the 'BeyerBolgerNoor_Env872_EDA_FinalProject' file you will find the 'Output', 'Data', and 'Code' files. 

In the 'Output' file, you will find the final Rmarkdown report on our findings. This will be a single Rmarkdown file. 

In the 'Data' file, you will find the data used within this analysis. Raw data was placed within the 'Raw' folder, processed data was placed in the 'Processed' file, and the metadata information was placed in the 'Metadata' file. Both the 'Raw' and 'Processed' files are in csv formats. The 'Metadata' files are in txt formats.

In the 'Code' file, you will find all the rmarkdown files and PDFs associated with the analysis of the data. This analysis was done in Rmarkdown files and then knit into PDF versions for reader accessability. Each Rmarkdown was named according to the analysis that was preformed.
