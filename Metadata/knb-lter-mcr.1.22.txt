       These data describe the species richness and abundance as part of MCR LTER's reef fish
    monitoring program to track long-term patterns in species abundance and diversity. This study
    began in 2000 in the lagoons off of the north shore of the island of Moorea, French Polynesia
    and the dataset is updated annually. The abundance and life history stage (adults, juveniles or
    recruits) of all taxa of fishes associated with selected colonies (5-16 colonies per site) of
    the mound forming coral Porites rus are recorded at seven reef sites located along the north
    shore of Moorea. These sites are characterized by differences in water depth, distance to the
    fore reef and the number and types of neighboring corals. Counts are performed by a pair of
    divers using SCUBA and include semi-cryptic species. The collection of these data was suspended
    following the last survey conducted in July 2011 due to the extremely low abundance of live P.
    rus at these locations.

            Diver Observation
            A pair of divers on SCUBA observe all fishes in association with a
							single colony of the mound forming coral, Porites rus. Divers use
							handheld flashlights to search the internal cavities of the colony for
							semi-cryptic species. All individuals are assigned to one of the
							following life history stages: adult, sub adult, juvenile or recruit.
							The total time spent observing each colony varies with colony size such
							that the time spent searching per cubic meter of coral volume is
							approximately constant across all colony sizes. Species richness values
							represent the total number of unique species at a site. Values for
							abundance represent the average number of total individuals seen per
							coral head surveyed at a site. Standard errors for abundance estimates
							are calculated using individual coral heads as replicates.
